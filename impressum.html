        </ul>

        <h2>Introduction and Overview</h2>
        <p>We have written this privacy policy (version 16.12.2024-122923306) in order to explain to you, in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as controllers – and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) – process, will process in the future and what lawful options you have. The terms used are to be understood in a gender-neutral way.</p>

        <p>In short, we provide you with comprehensive information about the data we process about you.</p>

        <p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terms. This privacy policy, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. As far as it is conducive to transparency, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly way, links to further information are offered and graphics are used. We are thus informing you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the course of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if you give the most concise, unclear and legal-technical explanations possible, as they are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection.</p>

        <p>If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body mentioned below or in the imprint, follow the existing links and look at further information on third-party sites. Of course, you can also find our contact details in the imprint.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as a person's name, e-mail address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill for our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this Privacy Policy includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
            <li>Social media presences and e-mail communication</li>
            <li>Mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short: The privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner in the company via the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>

        <h2>Legal bases</h2>
        <p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, that enable us to process personal data.</p>

        <p>As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016. Of course, you can read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the access to EU law, under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/</a>.</p>

        <p>We will only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)</span>: You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of your entered data of a contact form.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Contract (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)</span>: In order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we enter into a purchase contract with you, we require personal information in advance.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR)</span>: If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to keep invoices for accounting. These usually contain personal data.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)</span>: In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to operate our website in a secure and economically efficient manner. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other conditions such as the perception of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not usually occur with us. If such a legal basis should be relevant, it will be indicated in the appropriate place.</p>

        <p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Austria, this is the Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act), or DSG for short.</li>
            <li>In Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act, or BDSG for short, applies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>

        <h2>Contact details of the controller</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about data protection or the processing of personal data, you will find the contact details of the controller in accordance with Article 4 (7) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) below:</p>

            Phone: no phone
        </p>

        <h2>Storage period</h2>
        <p>The fact that we only store personal data for as long as it is strictly necessary for the provision of our services and products is a general criterion for us. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to retain certain data even after the original purpose has ceased to exist, for example for accounting purposes.</p>

        <p>If you wish to delete your data or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible and as long as there is no obligation to store it.</p>

        <p>We will inform you about the specific duration of the respective data processing below, if we have further information on this.</p>

        <h2>Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
        <p>In accordance with Articles 13, 14 GDPR, we inform you of the following rights to which you are entitled in order to ensure fair and transparent processing of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>According to Article 15 GDPR, you have a right to information about whether we process your data. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to receive information about:
                <ul>
                    <li>for what purpose we carry out the processing</li>
                    <li>the categories, i.e. the types of data that are processed</li>
                    <li>who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed</li>
                    <li>how long the data will be stored</li>
                    <li>the existence of the right to rectification, deletion or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing</li>
                    <li>that you can complain to a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below)</li>
                    <li>the origin of the data, if we have not collected it from you</li>
                    <li>whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated in order to arrive at a personal profile of you</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You have a right to rectification of the data according to Article 16 GDPR, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.</li>
            <li>According to Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"), which means that you can request the deletion of your data.</li>
            <li>According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means that we are only allowed to store the data but not use it further.</li>
            <li>You have the right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR, which means that we will provide you with your data in a commonly used format upon request.</li>
            <li>According to Article 21 GDPR, you have a right to object, which entails a change in the processing after enforcement.
                <ul>
                    <li>If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you may object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>
                    <li>If data is used for direct marketing, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We are not allowed to use your data for direct marketing thereafter.</li>
                    <li>If data is used for profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We are no longer allowed to use your data for profiling after that.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>According to Article 22 GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (e.g. profiling).</li>
            <li>You have the right to lodge a complaint in accordance with Article 77 of the GDPR. This means that you can always complain to the data protection authority if you believe that the data processing of personal data violates the GDPR.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short: You have rights – do not hesitate to contact the responsible body listed above!</p>

        <p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or that your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. For Austria, this is the data protection authority, whose website you can find under <a href="https://www.dsb.gv.at/">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In Germany, there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For more information, you can contact the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI). The following local data protection authority is responsible for our company:</p>

        <h3>Cookies Summary</h3>
        <p>👥 Data subjects: Visitors to the website<br>
        🤝 Purpose: depending on the cookie in question. You can find more details about this below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.<br>
        📓 Data processed: Depends on the cookie used. You can find more details about this below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.<br>

        <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
        <p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data. Below we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following privacy policy.</p>

        <p>Whenever you browse the web, use a browser. Well-known browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>

        <p>One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. To be more precise, they are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other applications. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by our website. These cookie files are automatically placed in the cookie folder, the "brain" of your browser, so to speak. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>

        <p>Cookies store certain user information about you, such as language or personal site settings. When you call up our site again, your browser transmits the "user-related" information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the setting you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, while in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>

        <p>The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser, such as Chrome, and the web server. In this case, the web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server, which the browser uses again as soon as another page is requested.</p>

        <p>HTTP cookie interaction between browser and web server</p>

        <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other "malware". Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>

        <p>For example, this is what cookie data can look like:</p>
        <p>Name: _ga<br>
        Value: GA1.2.1326744211.152122923306-9<br>
        Purpose: Differentiation of website visitors<br>
        Expiration date: after 2 years</p>

        <p>A browser should be able to support these minimum sizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
            <li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
            <li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What types of cookies are there?</h3>
        <p>The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and is clarified in the following sections of the Privacy Policy. At this point, we would like to briefly discuss the different types of HTTP cookies.</p>

        <p>There are 4 types of cookies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="highlight">Essential cookies</span><br>
            These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functionality of the website. For example, these cookies are needed when a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues to surf on other pages and only later goes to the checkout. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if the user closes his browser window.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Useful cookies</span><br>
            These cookies collect information about user behaviour and whether the user receives any error messages. In addition, these cookies are also used to measure the loading time and behavior of the website on different browsers.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Targeted cookies</span><br>
            These cookies provide a better user experience. For example, entered locations, font sizes or form data are stored.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Advertising cookies</span><br>
            These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They serve to provide the user with individually tailored advertising. This can be very practical, but also very annoying.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Usually, when you visit a website for the first time, you will be asked which of these types of cookies you would like to allow. And of course, this decision is also stored in a cookie.</p>

        <p>If you want to know more about cookies and are not afraid of technical documentation, we recommend <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>, the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) Request for Comments called the "HTTP State Management Mechanism".</p>

        <h3>Purpose of processing via cookies</h3>
        <p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. More details can be found below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.</p>

        <h3>What data is processed?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are little helpers for many different tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generalize which data is stored in cookies, but we will inform you about the processed or stored data within the framework of the following privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>Storage period of cookies</h3>
        <p>The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are deleted after less than an hour, others can remain stored on a computer for several years.</p>

        <p>You also have an influence on the storage period yourself. You can manually delete all cookies at any time via your browser (see also "Right to object" below). Furthermore, cookies based on consent will be deleted at the latest after your consent has been revoked, whereby the lawfulness of the storage remains unaffected until then.</p>

        <h3>Right to object – how can I delete cookies?</h3>
        <p>You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of the service or website from which the cookies originate, you always have the option of deleting, disabling or only partially allowing cookies. For example, you can block third-party cookies, but allow all other cookies.</p>

        <p>If you want to know which cookies have been stored in your browser when you want to change or delete cookie settings, you can find this in your browser settings:</p>

        <p>If you do not want cookies in principle, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. This allows you to decide whether or not to allow the cookie for each individual cookie. The procedure varies depending on the browser. The best thing to do is to search for the instructions in Google with the search term "delete cookies Chrome" or "disable cookies Chrome" in the case of a Chrome browser.</p>

        <h3>Legal basis</h3>
        <p>Since 2009, the so-called "Cookie Policy" has been in place. It states that the storage of cookies requires your consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). However, there are still very different reactions to these directives within the EU countries. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 165 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (2021). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this directive was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG), which has been replaced by the Digital Services Act (DDG) since May 2024.</p>

        <p>For strictly necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to provide a pleasant user experience for visitors to the website, and certain cookies are often strictly necessary for this.</p>

        <p>Unless absolutely necessary cookies are used, this will only happen if you give your consent. The legal basis in this respect is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.</p>

        <p>In the following sections, you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies, if the software used uses cookies.</p>

        <h2>Explanation of terms used</h2>
        <p>We always strive to make our privacy policy as clear and understandable as possible. However, this is not always easy, especially when it comes to technical and legal topics. It often makes sense to use legal terms (such as personal data) or certain technical terms (such as cookies, IP address). But we don't want to use it without explanation. Below you will find an alphabetical list of important terms used that we may not have sufficiently addressed in the previous privacy policy. If these terms have been taken from the GDPR and they are definitions, we will also cite the GDPR texts here and, if necessary, add our own explanations.</p>

        <h3>Processor</h3>
        <p><em>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</em></p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
        <p>'processor' means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;</p>
        <p><em>Explanation</em>: As a company and website owner, we are responsible for all the data we process about you. In addition to the controllers, there may also be so-called processors. This includes any company or person who processes personal data on our behalf. In addition to service providers such as tax consultants, processors can therefore also be hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.</p>

        <h3>Consent</h3>
        <p><em>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</em></p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
        <p>'consent' means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes, in the form of a statement or other clear affirmative action, by which the data subject signifies that he or she agrees to the processing of personal data concerning him or her;</p>
        <p><em>Explanation</em>: As a rule, such consent is given via a cookie consent tool for websites. You probably know this. Whenever you visit a website for the first time, you will usually be asked via a banner whether you agree or consent to data processing. In most cases, you can also make individual settings and thus decide for yourself which data processing you allow and which you do not. If you do not consent, no personal data of yours may be processed. In principle, consent can of course also be given in writing, i.e. not via a tool.</p>

        <h3>Personal data</h3>
        <p><em>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</em></p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
        <p>"personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;</p>
        <p><em>Explanation</em>: Personal data is therefore all data that can identify you as a person. This is usually data such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>E-mail address</li>
            <li>Postal address</li>
            <li>Telephone number</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>Identification numbers such as social security number, tax identification number, ID card number or matriculation number</li>
            <li>Bank details such as account number, credit information, account balances and much more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), your IP address is also considered personal data. IT experts can use your IP address to determine at least the approximate location of your device and, subsequently, you as the owner of the connection. Therefore, the storage of an IP address also requires a legal basis within the meaning of the GDPR. There are also so-called "special categories" of personal data, which are also particularly worthy of protection. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>racial and ethnic origin</li>
            <li>political opinions</li>
            <li>religious or ideological beliefs</li>
            <li>trade union membership</li>
            <li>genetic data, such as data taken from blood or saliva samples</li>
            <li>biometric data (this is information about psychological, physical or behavioral characteristics that can identify a person).</li>
            <li>Health Data on sexual orientation or sex life Profiling Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Profiling</h3>
        <p><em>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</em></p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
        <p>"profiling" means any type of automated processing of personal data consisting in the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to that natural person's work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;</p>
        <p><em>Explanation</em>: Profiling is the process of gathering various pieces of information about a person in order to learn more about that person. In the web sector, profiling is often used for advertising purposes or for credit checks. Web or advertising analytics programs, for example, collect data about your behavior and interests on a website. This results in a special user profile with the help of which advertising can be played out specifically to a target group.</p>

        <h3>Person in charge</h3>
        <p><em>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</em></p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
        <p>'controller' means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its designation may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</p>
        <p><em>Explanation</em>: In our case, we are responsible for the processing of your personal data and are therefore the "controller". If we pass on collected data to other service providers for processing, they are "processors". For this purpose, a "Data Processing Agreement (DPA)" must be signed.</p>

        <h3>Processing</h3>
        <p><em>Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</em></p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p>
        <p>'processing' means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination; the restriction, deletion or destruction;</p>
        <p><em>Note</em>: When we talk about processing in our privacy policy, we mean any kind of data processing. As mentioned above in the original GDPR statement, this includes not only the collection but also the storage and processing of data.</p>
